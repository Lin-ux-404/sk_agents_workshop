# Azure AI Agents with Semantic Kernel Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs demonstrating the integration of Azure AI Agents Service with Semantic Kernel. The labs are designed to help developers understand and implement AI-powered solutions using Microsoft's latest AI technologies.

## Overview

This project was created during a hackathon to showcase practical applications of Azure AI Agents and Semantic Kernel working together. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks and sample applications, you'll learn how to work with both single agents and multi-agent systems.

The repository includes:
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks that teach the fundamentals of Azure AI Agents and Semantic Kernel
- Step-by-step tutorials progressing from basic single-agent scenarios to complex multi-agent interactions
- Sample applications demonstrating practical implementations of concepts covered in the notebooks
- Complete example scenarios showing real-world applications of AI agents

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Azure AI Services account
- Python 11.0.0 or later
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022
- Basic knowledge of Python and async programming
