    "\n",
    "While single agents are powerful for many applications, some tasks benefit from having multiple specialized agents working together. Multi-agent systems provide several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on what it does best\n",
    "2. **Role separation**: Different agents can take on different roles (critic, creator, researcher, etc.)\n",
    "3. **System reliability**: If one agent struggles, others can compensate\n",
    "4. **Complex problem-solving**: Breaking down problems into sub-tasks handled by different agents\n",
    "5. **Natural collaboration flow**: Mimicking how humans collaborate in teams\n",

    "\n",
    "Key components of an `AgentGroupChat` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents**: The collection of agents participating in the conversation\n",
    "2. **Selection Strategy**: Determines which agent speaks next\n",
    "3. **Termination Strategy**: Decides when the conversation should end\n",
    "4. **Chat History**: The shared conversation context visible to all agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation flow is typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User adds a message to the group chat\n",
    "2. Selection strategy chooses which agent responds next\n",
    "3. Selected agent processes the conversation history and generates a response\n",
    "4. Response is added to the chat history\n",
    "5. Termination strategy checks if conversation should end\n",
    "6. If not terminated, process repeats from step 2"
